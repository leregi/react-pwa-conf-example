This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### convert a react app to a pwa

Step 1 — Add the new dependencies

$ yarn add workbox-webpack-plugin 
$ yarn add react-app-rewire-workbox 
$ yarn add react-app-rewired

Step 2— Create config-overrides.js file
Create a file in the root of your project called config-overrides.js

const {rewireWorkboxInject, defaultInjectConfig} = require('react-app-rewire-workbox');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = function override(config, env) {
  if (env === "production") {
    console.log("Production build - Adding Workbox for PWAs");
    // Extend the default injection config with required swSrc
    const workboxConfig = {
      ...defaultInjectConfig,
      swSrc: path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'custom-sw.js')
    };
    config = rewireWorkboxInject(workboxConfig)(config, env);
  }

  return config;
};





Step 3— Replace the react-scripts properties

{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test --env=jsdom",
  },
  ...
}

Step 4— Create custom-sw.js file
Now create a custom-sw.js file in your src/ folder and paste this code:

// See https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/configure-workbox
workbox.core.setLogLevel(workbox.core.LOG_LEVELS.debug);

self.addEventListener('install', event => event.waitUntil(self.skipWaiting()));
self.addEventListener('activate', event => event.waitUntil(self.clients.claim()));

// We need this in Webpack plugin (refer to swSrc option): https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin#full_injectmanifest_config
workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__precacheManifest);

// app-shell
workbox.routing.registerRoute("/", workbox.strategies.networkFirst());

Step 5— Change the default service worker file name

Change the default name of your service worker to custom-sw.js in the registerServiceWorker.js file

export default function register() {  
  // Some validations here
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const swUrl = `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/custom-sw.js`; // In this line
    ...
  }
  // Another stuffs here
}
